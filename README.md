# RoboBibb's Practice Programs
When we have meetings and programmers are taught how to code, we often make practice programs. 
This is a collection of the ones we've made in the past. In addition, we make some programs which
demonstrate ideas well and are good for helping new programmers get a feel for the language and/or features.
Some experience with C/C++ is assumed, and you may have a hard time simply jumping into these.

# Contribute:
If you make a well commented, short program as a practice project feel free to add it here. 

# Languages Used:
* C++: used for the robot in addition to some other projects we do in free-time
  + notoriously hard to teach and given that most people don't learn much befor joining it makes it more difficult
  + teaching is our biggest priority and isn't particularly easy
* C: used as a bridge to C++ although it often confuses people as to the correlation. used for simple programs.
  + easier to teach than C++, but not useful
  + we don't teach explicitly teach the language, but we do explain it's relation to C++
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript: used for our website (https://robobibb.github.io/)
  + many incoming members have at least a minimal understanding of HTML, and can quickly pick up the basics of the others
  + teaching isn't a major challenge or prority

# practice
some practice programs that we can go through to help beginners learn how to code
[most of] These assume that you already have some experience in the language, and only want to improve

# languages we use:
- C++: used for the robot in addition to some other projects we do in free-timeC
 - notoriously hard to teach and given that most people don't learn much befor joining it makes it more difficult
 - teaching is our biggest priority and isn't particularly easy
- C: used as a bridge to C++ although it often confuses people as to the correlation. used for simple programs.
 - easier to teach than C++, but not useful
 - we don't teach explicitly teach the language, but we do explain it's relation to C++
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: used for our website (https://robobibb.github.io/)
 - many incoming members have at least a minimal understanding of HTML, and can quickly pick up the basics of the others
 - teaching isn't a major challenge or prority
